                    <p>The earliest forms of competitive gaming can be traced back to the 1970s, with events like the 
                        "Intergalactic Spacewar Olympics" in 1972 at Stanford University. The prize was a year's 
                        subscription to Rolling Stone magazine. The 21st century marked a significant consolidation 
                        of esports, with the professionalization of teams, coaches, and training regimens, mirroring 
                        traditional sports. Platforms like Twitch and YouTube became crucial for broadcasting and fan engagement.</p>
